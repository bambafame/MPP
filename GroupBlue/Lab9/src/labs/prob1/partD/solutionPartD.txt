In EmployeeInfo.java, removeDuplicates() uses a
HashMap<Employee, Employee> to detect duplicates. But visited starts as false,
and later gets set to true for duplicates. This changes the object's internal state,
which alters the result of both equals() and hashCode() because they both include visited
As a solution, we should delete visited field in both equals() and hashCode() method
